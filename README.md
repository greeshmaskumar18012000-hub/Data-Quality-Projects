# UPI Transaction Data Quality Framework Using SQL


Problem Statement

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has become the backbone of digital payments across banking, fintech, retail, utilities, and public services. However, the high volume and real-time nature of UPI transactions introduce critical data quality challenges that can impact fraud detection, regulatory compliance, operational reconciliation, and business analytics.

Organizations often encounter:

Duplicate transactions due to retries or system lags
Invalid or malformed UPI handles (VPAs)
Incorrect or missing timestamps and settlement dates
Inconsistent status codes and missing reference numbers
Transactions with invalid amounts or geolocation gaps
These issues lead to operational failures, delayed settlements, inaccurate reporting to regulators (e.g. NPCI/RBI), and compromised fraud detection systems.

This project implements a scalable, SQL-based data quality framework to:

Profile UPI transaction data
Detect and flag rule violations using 10+ business-defined quality rules
Score data quality per transaction and batch
Provide scripts for identifying and optionally remediating issues
The framework is applicable across multiple industries processing UPI payments and aligns with enterprise-grade data governance, fraud mitigation, and BI practices.
